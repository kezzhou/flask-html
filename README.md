# flask-html
HHA 504 // Week 3 // Assignment 3 // Part 1

## In this repo we take a jump from deploying a flask app locally and remotely to deploying one that is a little more structured with html and a little more beautified with css.

## This repo's flask app is manually styled. For a flask app that is more custom designed with Bootstrap, see: https://github.com/kezzhou/flask-bootstrap

## The focus of this repo will be on styling and structure. Functionality is not yet a primary focus.

## Standard templates and static folders are provided, with .html and .css folders populating them, respectively. We also have an images folder where we store the images referred to by the .htmls. We'll keep the app.py file "out in the open" rather than placing it into a scripts folder so that it can identify the static and templates folders more easily.

## We pull frameworks from W3schools - specifically the Flexbox Layout, which promises adjusting to different screen sizes and display sizes.
