# flask-html
HHA 504 // Week 3 // Assignment 3 // Part 1

## In this repo we take a jump from deploying a flask app locally and remotely to deploying one that is a little more structured with html and a little more beautified with css.

## This repo's flask app is manually styled. For a flask app that is more custom designed with Bootstrap, see: https://github.com/kezzhou/flask-bootstrap

## The focus of this repo will be on styling and structure. Functionality is not yet a primary focus.

## Standard templates and static folders are provided, with .html and .css folders populating them, respectively. We'll keep the app.py file "out in the open" rather than placing it into a scripts folder so that it can identify the static and templates folders more easily. The screenshots folder contains screen grabs of the functioning websites on the localhost.

## We pull frameworks from W3schools - specifically the Flexbox Layout, which promises adjusting to different screen sizes and display sizes.

## note: originally attempted to use downloaded images but path would not register. Switched to using url of online images and alt text as temp fix.

## note 2: sorry professor, had a little fun with this one. Haha. Will be more health portal oriented for future iterations.
