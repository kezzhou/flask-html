# flask-html
HHA 504 // Week 3 // Assignment 3 // Part 1

## In this repo we take a jump from deploying a flask app locally and remotely to deploying one that is a little more structured with html and a little more beautified with css.

## This repo's flask app is manually styled. For a flask app that is more custom designed with Bootstrap, see: https://github.com/kezzhou/flask-bootstrap

## The focus of this repo will be on styling and structure. Functionality is not yet a primary focus.

## Standard templates and static folders are provided, with .html and .css folders populating them, respectively. We'll keep the app.py file "out in the open" so that it can identify the static and templates folders more easily.
